# Guide to `experimental_optimizer.py`

## Purpose

The `experimental_optimizer.py` script serves as a sandbox and demonstration platform for integrating various advanced, experimental features into the LLM API Aggregator system. It showcases concepts drawn from research papers and popular AI frameworks, primarily through simulations. Its main goals are:

1.  To illustrate how techniques like programmatic prompt optimization (DSPy-like), multi-agent systems (AutoGen-like), and chained LLM calls (LangChain-like) could be conceptualized within the aggregator.
2.  To provide a version of an `OpenHandsIntegrator` class that can be targeted by `recursive_optimizer.py` for its self-improvement simulations.
3.  To demonstrate a (simulated) continuous optimization loop that invokes these experimental features.
4.  To include utilities like a `WindowsLocalRunner` for platform-specific setup.

The functionalities of the integrated components are largely **simulated** with hardcoded logic and do not typically involve actual LLM calls or true machine learning model interactions unless explicitly stated (and generally, they don't).

## Main Components and Simulated Functionalities

The script defines an `ExperimentalAggregator` class that orchestrates these components:

### 1. `DSPyPromptOptimizer`
*   **Concept**: Simulates prompt optimization inspired by the DSPy framework.
*   **Functionality**:
    *   `create_prompt_signature`: Defines a structure for prompt inputs/outputs.
    *   `optimize_with_bootstrap`: Takes a base prompt and examples, and returns an "optimized" prompt. The optimization is a template that appends guidelines and few-shot examples from the input.
    *   `_evaluate_prompt_improvement`: Simulates an evaluation score based on structural changes to the prompt.
*   **Simulation Level**: High. No actual compilation or LLM-based optimization occurs.

### 2. `AutoGenMultiAgent`
*   **Concept**: Simulates a multi-agent system for system optimization, inspired by Microsoft's AutoGen.
*   **Functionality**:
    *   Defines roles for agents: "analyzer," "optimizer," "validator," "implementer."
    *   `run_multi_agent_optimization`: Orchestrates a sequence of tasks for these agents.
    *   `_simulate_agent_processing`: Contains hardcoded responses for each agent type based on its role. For example, the "analyzer" returns predefined bottlenecks.
*   **Simulation Level**: High. Agents do not have independent LLMs; their interactions and outputs are scripted.

### 3. `LangChainPromptEngineer`
*   **Concept**: Simulates prompt engineering using chains, inspired by LangChain.
*   **Functionality**:
    *   `create_optimization_chain`: Defines chains as a sequence of named steps (e.g., "analyze_task," "generate_prompts").
    *   `_create_step_template`: Provides hardcoded prompt templates for each step.
    *   `run_optimization_chain`: Iterates through the steps, "formats" the template for the current step with data from previous steps, and calls `_process_chain_step`.
    *   `_process_chain_step`: Contains hardcoded logic to return simulated outputs for each specific step name.
*   **Simulation Level**: High. No actual LLM calls are made to process the templates. Data flow between steps is simulated. Recent fixes have improved the data consistency between these simulated steps to prevent `KeyError` warnings.

### 4. `OpenHandsIntegrator` (within `experimental_optimizer.py`)
*   **Concept**: Represents a component of the system that can be targeted for analysis and "improvement" (e.g., by `recursive_optimizer.py`). It also simulates performing optimization tasks itself.
*   **Functionality**:
    *   `analyze_system_with_openhands`: Simulates OpenHands analyzing the LLM aggregator and returning predefined suggestions.
    *   `implement_openhands_suggestions`: Simulates implementing some of these suggestions.
    *   `create_openhands_optimization_session`: Sets up a list of predefined tasks for different focus areas (performance, prompt_optimization, auto_updater).
    *   `simulate_openhands_execution`: Simulates the execution of these tasks, returning mock improvements.
*   **Simulation Level**: High. This is the base class that `recursive_optimizer.py` reads to generate its `OpenHandsIntegratorV1`, `V2`, etc., clones.

### 5. `WindowsLocalRunner`
*   **Concept**: Provides utilities for setting up and running the application on a Windows environment.
*   **Functionality**:
    *   Checks if the system is Windows and if Docker is available.
    *   `setup_windows_environment`: Creates necessary directories, a Windows service script (`windows_service.py`), a startup batch file (`start_aggregator.bat`), and a Windows-specific configuration file (`windows_config.json`).
    *   `install_as_service`: Attempts to install the `windows_service.py` as a Windows service using `pywin32`.
*   **Simulation Level**: Low to Medium. It generates actual script files. The service installation requires `pywin32` and appropriate permissions.

### `ExperimentalAggregator` Orchestration
*   **`initialize()`**: Sets up a standard `LLMAggregator` (from `src.core.aggregator`) with its associated components (`AccountManager`, `ProviderRouter`, `RateLimiter`, `AutoUpdater`, `MetaModelController`, `EnsembleSystem`). It also instantiates the experimental components listed above. Recent fixes corrected critical import and instantiation errors in this method.
*   **`start_advanced_optimization_loop()`**: Runs an infinite loop (until interrupted) that:
    *   Collects (mostly simulated) system data.
    *   Calls the DSPy, AutoGen, LangChain, and OpenHands simulation methods.
*   **`start_enhanced_dashboard()`**: Uses the `rich` library to display a live-updating text-based dashboard in the console, showing simulated metrics and statuses.

## How to Run

The script can be executed directly:
```bash
python experimental_optimizer.py
```
It defaults to `--mode=local`.

## Output Signification

*   **Initialization Logs**: Shows the setup of the `LLMAggregator` and the experimental components.
*   **Optimization Loop**: Logs messages from the simulated DSPy, AutoGen, LangChain, and OpenHands features (e.g., "DSPy optimization completed," "LangChain optimization chains completed," "OpenHands completed: ...").
*   **AutoUpdater Logs**: The `AutoUpdater` (part of the core `LLMAggregator`) will run and attempt to fetch updates. Expect errors for API sources if keys are not configured.
*   **Rich Dashboard**: A text-based dashboard will continuously update in the console, showing simulated performance metrics, agent statuses, etc.

## Current Status & Limitations

*   **Simulated Core Logic**: The "intelligence" of the experimental optimizers (DSPy, AutoGen, LangChain, OpenHandsIntegrator's self-optimization) is almost entirely simulated with hardcoded outputs and logic. They demonstrate concepts rather than providing true AI-driven optimization.
*   **Dependencies**:
    *   Requires `rich` for the dashboard.
    *   Requires `numpy` for some calculations (even if basic).
    *   `WindowsLocalRunner` functionality for service installation requires `pywin32` (on Windows).
    *   The core `LLMAggregator` has its own set of dependencies (FastAPI, httpx, etc.), which are needed for `ExperimentalAggregator` to initialize it.
*   **Error Handling**: Basic. Some simulations might not be robust to unexpected states, though recent fixes have improved this for the LangChain part.
*   **Configuration**: Relies on the centralized settings from `src/config/settings.py` for the core `LLMAggregator` parts. The `WindowsLocalRunner` creates its own `windows_config.json`.

This script is a valuable tool for demonstrating and iterating on complex AI system concepts in a controlled, simulated environment.
