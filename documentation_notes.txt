## Documentation Updates for Advanced Research & Python Code Generation

The following updates should be incorporated into `README.md` or a new `FEATURES.md` file:

### New Dependencies:
(This section can be merged or kept if other non-Tavily/non-httpx dependencies are noted elsewhere. For now, the new section below covers httpx, beautifulsoup4, and tavily-python)

### Enhanced Python Code Generation (`MultiLanguageCodeGenerator`):
- **LLM-Based Generation:** Python code is generated using an LLM based on detailed specifications.
- **Basic Code Analysis (`PythonAnalyzer`):**
  - Generated Python code undergoes a basic structural analysis using Python's `ast` module.
  - Information extracted includes imports, top-level functions (names, args, docstring presence), and classes (names, methods, docstring presence). This analysis is currently for reporting/logging.
- **Basic Code Quality Checking (`CodeQualityChecker`):**
  - Custom checks are performed on generated Python code:
    - Detection of "TODO" / "FIXME" comments.
    - Lines exceeding a configured maximum length (default 100).
    - Basic check for docstring presence in functions, classes, and methods (using AST analysis results).
  - A naive quality score and a list of issues are reported in the `CodeGenerationResult`.
- **Limitations:**
  - Code analysis and quality checking are basic and do not replace comprehensive linting or static analysis tools.
  - The system does not yet use analysis/quality feedback for iterative code refinement with the LLM.
  - Support for languages other than Python in `MultiLanguageCodeGenerator` is still pending.

### Simulation Script:
- `run_planning_simulation.py` has been updated to demonstrate these new live research and enhanced Python code generation capabilities. Note that live web requests can make the simulation slower and dependent on network connectivity.

## Enhanced Web Research with Tavily AI Integration (Update to Previous Research Section)

The `WebResearcher` component has been significantly updated to use **Tavily AI** as its primary engine for web searches, replacing the previous basic Google search scraping method. This provides more robust, relevant, and semantically rich search results.

### Key Changes & Features:
-   **Primary Search Engine:** Tavily AI is now used for performing searches via the `WebResearcher.search_with_tavily()` method. This method leverages Tavily's capabilities for context-aware searching and often returns processed summaries along with source URLs.
-   **New Dependencies (ensure these are in `requirements.txt`):**
    -   `tavily-python`: Client library for interacting with the Tavily AI search API.
    -   `httpx`: For making asynchronous HTTP requests (used by `WebResearcher` for fetching full content from URLs provided by Tavily or other sources).
    -   `beautifulsoup4`: For parsing HTML content (used by `WebResearcher` for extracting text from fetched pages).
-   **API Key Configuration:**
    -   A **`TAVILY_API_KEY`** environment variable is now **required** to use the enhanced web research functionality.
    -   This key should be obtained from [Tavily AI](https://tavily.com/) and set in your environment (e.g., in a `.env` file).
    -   The application loads this key via `settings.TAVILY_API_KEY`. Without it, Tavily searches will fail.
-   **Updated Data Structures (`src/core/research_structures.py`):**
    -   `SearchResult` has been renamed to `WebSearchResult` and its fields updated to better align with rich outputs from services like Tavily (e.g., `url`, `title`, `content_summary` from Tavily, `score` from Tavily, `raw_content_full` for optional full page fetch by our system).
    -   A new `TavilySearchSessionReport` dataclass stores overall information from a Tavily search session (e.g., echoed query, overall answer if provided by Tavily).
-   **Local Relevance Scoring (`RelevanceScorer`):**
    -   The `RelevanceScorer` now processes `WebSearchResult` objects from Tavily.
    -   It intelligently decides whether to use Tavily's provided `content_summary` or to fetch the full page content (using the retained `WebResearcher.fetch_and_parse_live_content()` method with `httpx` and `BeautifulSoup`) for its own LLM-based local relevance scoring.
-   **Orchestration (`IntelligentResearchAssistant`):**
    -   The main `research_for_task()` method now orchestrates the flow using Tavily search first, followed by local relevance scoring and knowledge synthesis.
-   **Deprecated Google Search:**
    -   The previous method `WebResearcher._search_google_scrape` (which constructed Google search URLs and scraped HTML) is now deprecated due to its unreliability and should not be used as a primary search mechanism.
-   **Simulation Script:**
    -   `run_planning_simulation.py` has been updated to use the Tavily-powered `WebResearcher` and requires `TAVILY_API_KEY` to be set for the research parts to function fully.

This integration aims to provide significantly more powerful and reliable research capabilities to the system.

## Further Enhancements to Python Code Generation (Update to Previous Code Generation Section)

The Python code generation capabilities within `MultiLanguageCodeGenerator` have been further enhanced with a best practices integration and more detailed quality checks.

### New: Best Practices Integration (`BestPracticesDatabase`):
-   A `BestPracticesDatabase` component has been implemented.
-   It loads Python-specific best practices from a JSON file: `config/python_best_practices.json`.
    -   This JSON file is structured by categories (e.g., "general", "functions", "classes", "error_handling", "imports") and contains lists of best practice strings.
    -   An initial set of common Python best practices has been included in this file.
-   When generating Python code, `MultiLanguageCodeGenerator` now retrieves relevant practices from this database (based on default categories like "general", "functions", etc.) and includes them in the prompt to the LLM. This aims to guide the LLM towards generating code that adheres more closely to common Python conventions and good coding habits.

### Enhanced Code Quality Checking (`CodeQualityChecker`):
The `CodeQualityChecker` for Python has been made more robust with the following additional custom checks, leveraging more detailed AST analysis from `PythonAnalyzer`:
-   **Naming Conventions:**
    -   Basic check for `snake_case` for function names, method names (excluding dunders), and argument names (excluding `self`, `cls`).
    -   Basic check for `PascalCase` for class names.
-   **Function/Method Max Length:**
    -   Checks if the body of a function or method exceeds a configurable maximum number of lines (default set in `CodeQualityChecker`, e.g., 50 lines). This uses line number information derived from AST node boundaries.
-   **Wildcard Imports:**
    -   Detects and flags `from module import *` statements.
-   **Basic `try-except` Review:**
    -   Identifies the use of generic `except:` or `except Exception:` clauses and suggests using more specific exception types. This relies on `PythonAnalyzer` identifying such clauses.
-   **Existing Checks Retained:** Checks for "TODO"/"FIXME" comments, overly long lines, and basic docstring presence remain.
-   **Quality Score:** The naive quality score calculation is adjusted based on the increased number of potential issues.

### Updated `PythonAnalyzer`:
-   To support the enhanced quality checks, `PythonAnalyzer.analyze_code_structure` now extracts more detailed information from the Python code's AST:
    -   Approximate line counts for function and method bodies.
    -   Line numbers where generic exception handlers (`except:`, `except Exception:`) are used.
    -   Start and end line numbers for function and class definitions.

These enhancements aim to improve the quality, readability, and maintainability of the Python code generated by the system. The simulation script (`run_planning_simulation.py`) logs the more detailed quality reports.

## Python Code Generation Elevated to Production-Grade Standards

The Python code generation pipeline (`MultiLanguageCodeGenerator` and its components) has undergone significant enhancements to improve the quality, adherence to best practices, and robustness of the generated code.

### Key Enhancements:

1.  **Comprehensive Best Practices (`BestPracticesDatabase`):**
    *   The `config/python_best_practices.json` file has been greatly expanded to include a more diverse and detailed set of Python best practices. These cover areas such as:
        *   Readability and Naming Conventions
        *   Function and Class Design
        *   Effective Error Handling
        *   Import Management
        *   Performance Considerations
        *   Basic Security Principles
        *   Idiomatic Python Usage
    *   These comprehensive practices are now systematically included in the prompts sent to the LLM when generating Python code, providing stronger guidance.

2.  **Flake8 Integration for Code Quality (`CodeQualityChecker`):**
    *   The `CodeQualityChecker` for Python code now programmatically integrates **`flake8`** for static analysis.
    *   When Python code is generated, it is automatically checked by `flake8` (run as a subprocess using `sys.executable -m flake8 --isolated --format="%(row)d,%(col)d,%(code)s,%(text)s"`).
    *   Issues reported by `flake8` (errors, warnings, style violations) are captured, parsed, and included in the `CodeGenerationResult.issues_found` list, each marked with `type: "flake8"`.
    *   **Note:** For this feature to work optimally, `flake8` should be available in the Python environment where the application is running. It is included as a development dependency in `requirements.txt`.

3.  **Augmented Custom Quality Checks:**
    *   Existing custom AST-based checks in `CodeQualityChecker` (e.g., for TODO/FIXME comments, docstring presence, specific naming patterns, function length, wildcard imports, generic exceptions) are retained.
    *   Some custom checks (like line length) are now conditional and may be superseded if `flake8` already reports a similar issue (e.g., E501 for line length), avoiding redundant warnings.
    *   These custom checks provide an additional layer of quality assessment and can enforce project-specific standards not covered by default `flake8` configurations.

4.  **Detailed Quality Reporting:**
    *   The `CodeGenerationResult` now provides a more detailed quality assessment:
        *   `issues_found`: A structured list of dictionaries, each detailing an issue from `flake8` or custom checks (including line, column, error code, and message).
        *   `quality_score`: A refined (though still naive) score that considers penalties from both `flake8` issues and custom check violations.
        *   `flake8_issue_count` and `custom_issue_count` for a summary.

5.  **Enhanced `PythonAnalyzer`:**
    *   The `PythonAnalyzer` (using `ast`) has been updated to extract more detailed structural information (e.g., function body line counts, locations of generic exception handlers) to support the enhanced custom checks in `CodeQualityChecker`.

### Impact:
These improvements aim to produce Python code that is not only functional but also more readable, maintainable, and adherent to established Python conventions and quality standards, making the code generation feature more suitable for production-grade applications. The simulation script (`run_planning_simulation.py`) has been updated to demonstrate these enhanced checks using specific test prompts.
