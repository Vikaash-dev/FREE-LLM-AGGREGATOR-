# ADA-7 Usage Guide

## Overview

The Advanced Development Assistant (ADA-7) is a comprehensive framework for structured, evidence-based software development. It guides projects through 7 evolutionary stages, from initial requirements to continuous maintenance, with academic research validation and quantified decision-making.

## Quick Start

### Installation

The ADA-7 framework is included in the LLM Aggregator package. No additional installation required.

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Vikaash-dev/FREE-LLM-AGGREGATOR-.git
cd FREE-LLM-AGGREGATOR-

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run demo
python ada7_demo.py
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from src.core.ada7.framework import ADA7Framework

# Initialize framework
ada7 = ADA7Framework()

# Start new project
project = await ada7.start_project(
    name="My Application",
    description="Brief description of your application",
    constraints={
        "budget": 10000,
        "timeline": "3 months",
        "team_size": 3
    }
)

# Execute all stages

## Integration with LLM Aggregator

### Using with Existing Aggregator

```python
from src.core.aggregator import LLMAggregator
from src.core.meta_controller import MetaModelController
from src.core.ada7.framework import ADA7Framework

# Initialize LLM infrastructure
aggregator = LLMAggregator()
meta_controller = MetaModelController(aggregator)

# Initialize ADA-7 with AI support
ada7 = ADA7Framework(
    aggregator=aggregator,
    meta_controller=meta_controller
)
```

### Benefits of Integration

1. **Intelligent Model Selection**: Automatically selects best LLM for each task
2. **Cost Optimization**: Uses free-tier models when appropriate
3. **Multi-Model Validation**: Ensemble system for critical decisions
4. **Research Integration**: Leverages academic papers for validation
5. **Continuous Learning**: Improves recommendations over time

## Knowledge Base Management

### Adding Academic Papers

```python
from src.core.ada7.framework import AcademicReference

paper = AcademicReference(
    authors="Smith et al.",
    year=2024,
    title="Advanced Software Architecture Patterns",
    arxiv_id="2401.12345",
    citation_count=100
)

ada7.add_academic_reference(paper)
```

### Adding GitHub Repositories

```python
from src.core.ada7.framework import GitHubRepository

repo = GitHubRepository(
    owner="example",
    name="awesome-project",
    url="https://github.com/example/awesome-project",
    stars=5000,
    last_commit_days_ago=3,
    description="Example project demonstrating best practices"
)

ada7.add_github_repository(repo)
```

### Searching Knowledge Base

```python
# Search academic papers
papers = ada7.search_academic_papers(
    keywords=["microservices", "architecture"],
    min_relevance=0.5
)

# Search GitHub repositories
repos = ada7.search_github_repositories(
    keywords=["python", "api"],
    min_stars=1000
)
```

## Decision Making with Decision Matrix

```python
# Create decision matrix
matrix = ada7.create_decision_matrix(
    alternatives=["Option A", "Option B", "Option C"],
    criteria=["cost", "performance", "scalability"],
    weights={
        "cost": 0.3,
        "performance": 0.4,
        "scalability": 0.3
    }
)

# Add scores
matrix.scores = {
    "Option A": {"cost": 8.0, "performance": 7.0, "scalability": 6.0},
    "Option B": {"cost": 6.0, "performance": 9.0, "scalability": 8.0},
    "Option C": {"cost": 7.0, "performance": 6.0, "scalability": 9.0}
}

# Get recommendation
best = matrix.get_best_alternative()
scores = matrix.calculate_weighted_scores()
```

## Project Management

### Checking Project Status

```python
# Get status of a specific project
status = ada7.get_project_status(project.project_id)

# List all projects
projects = ada7.list_projects()
```

### Executing Stages Individually

```python
# Execute stages one by one for fine-grained control
stage1 = await ada7.execute_stage_1(project)
stage2 = await ada7.execute_stage_2(project, stage1)
stage3 = await ada7.execute_stage_3(project, stage2)
# ... and so on
```

### Executing All Stages at Once

```python
# Execute all stages in sequence
results = await ada7.execute_all_stages(project)

# Access any stage results
stage1_results = results['stages']['stage1']
stage2_results = results['stages']['stage2']
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Define Clear Constraints

Always provide specific constraints to guide the framework:

```python
constraints = {
    "budget": 50000,              # Total budget in USD
    "timeline": "6 months",       # Development timeline
    "team_size": 5,               # Number of developers
    "target_users": 10000,        # Expected user base
    "compliance": ["GDPR", "SOC2"],  # Regulatory requirements
    "technology_preference": "Python/React"  # Tech preferences
}
```

### 2. Populate Knowledge Base

Regularly update the knowledge base with relevant papers and repositories:

```python
# Add domain-specific papers
ada7.add_academic_reference(paper)

# Add reference implementations
ada7.add_github_repository(repo)
```

### 3. Review Each Stage

Don't skip stages - each builds on previous results:

```python
# Review Stage 1 before proceeding
stage1 = await ada7.execute_stage_1(project)
print("Requirements:", stage1['requirements'])

# Proceed to Stage 2
stage2 = await ada7.execute_stage_2(project)
```

### 4. Use Decision Matrices

For important decisions, use decision matrices with proper weighting:

```python
matrix = ada7.create_decision_matrix(
    alternatives=[...],
    criteria=[...],
    weights={...}  # Ensure weights sum to 1.0
)
```

### 5. Integrate with LLM Aggregator

Leverage AI assistance for each stage:

```python
ada7 = ADA7Framework(
    aggregator=aggregator,
    meta_controller=meta_controller
)
```

## Examples

- `ada7_demo.py` - Basic framework demonstration
- `ada7_integration_example.py` - Integration with LLM aggregator
- `ADA7_FRAMEWORK.md` - Complete framework documentation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Stage fails with missing dependencies
```python
# Solution: Ensure previous stage completed successfully
if project.stage1_results is None:
    stage1_results = await ada7.execute_stage_1(project)
```

**Issue**: Decision matrix weights don't sum to 1.0
```python
# Solution: Framework automatically normalizes weights
# But it's best practice to ensure they sum to 1.0
weights = {"cost": 0.3, "performance": 0.4, "scalability": 0.3}
assert sum(weights.values()) == 1.0
```

**Issue**: Knowledge base searches return no results
```python
# Solution: Populate knowledge base before searching
ada7.add_academic_reference(paper)
ada7.add_github_repository(repo)
```
