area7 = AREA7Master()

# Define goal
goal = {

    "exploratory": True,
    "novel": True,
    "constraints": ["Maintain accuracy"],
    "success_criteria": ["20% improvement"]

```

### Multi-Agent Usage

```python
from multi_agent_personalities import MultiAgentCoordinator
from area7_framework import MemoryManager, AuditLogger

memory = MemoryManager()
audit = AuditLogger()
coordinator = MultiAgentCoordinator(memory, audit)

problem = {"description": "Research problem"}
results = await coordinator.execute_pipeline(problem)
```

### Running Tests

```bash
pytest tests/test_area7_framework.py -v
```

### Running Examples

```bash
python area7_examples.py
```

## Integration with Existing System

The AREA-7 framework can be easily integrated with the existing experimental optimizer:

```python
from area7_framework import AREA7Master
from experimental_optimizer import ExperimentalAggregator

# Use AREA-7 for research-driven optimization
area7 = AREA7Master()
experimental = ExperimentalAggregator()

# Discover optimizations
goal = {"description": "Optimize routing", "exploratory": True}
results = await area7.execute(goal)

# Apply to existing system
if results.get("validated"):
    await experimental.apply_optimization(results["discovery"])
```

## Next Steps

The framework is complete and ready for use. Possible future enhancements:
