## Usage Example

```python
from src.core.ada7 import ADA7Framework

# Initialize ADA-7 framework
ada7 = ADA7Framework()

# Start new project development
project = await ada7.start_project(
    name="AI-Powered Task Manager",
    description="Multi-platform task management with AI assistance",
    constraints={
        "budget": 10000,
        "timeline": "3 months",
        "team_size": 3
    }
)

# Progress through stages
stage1_results = await ada7.execute_stage_1(project)
stage2_results = await ada7.execute_stage_2(project, stage1_results)
# ... continue through all stages
```
