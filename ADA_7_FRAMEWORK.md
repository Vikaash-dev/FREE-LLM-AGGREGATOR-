  - llamaindex: "Good vision model support"
  - openai_api: "GPT-4 Vision reference implementation"

feature_gap: "No unified multi-modal routing across providers"
```

#### Stage 2: Architecture
```yaml
architecture_change: "Add ImageProcessor component"

options:
  - "Preprocessing layer before routing"
  - "Provider-specific image handling"
  - "Unified multi-modal message format"

selected: "Unified multi-modal message format"

academic_backing:
  - "[Liu et al., 2024, 'Multi-Modal LLM APIs', arXiv:2402.12345]"
```

#### Stage 3: Component Design
```yaml
new_component:
  name: "ImageProcessor"
  responsibilities:
    - "Image format validation"
    - "Resizing and compression"
    - "Base64 encoding"
  
  technology: "Pillow 10.1.0"

    output: "Base64 encoded string with metadata"
```

#### Stage 4: Implementation
```yaml

  - "Encoding pipeline (5 pts)"

pipeline_update:
  - stage: "image_processing"
    steps:
      - "Validate image"
      - "Resize if needed"
      - "Encode to base64"
```

```

#### Stage 6: Deployment
```yaml
deployment_change: "No infrastructure changes needed"

  - metric: "image_processing_time"
    threshold: "<500ms"
```

#### Stage 7: Maintenance
```yaml
documentation:
  - location: "docs/features/multi-modal.md"

## Conclusion

ADA-7 represents a comprehensive, structured approach to software development that:

1. **Grounds decisions in evidence** (academic research + industry practice)
2. **Follows a clear methodology** (7 evolutionary stages)
3. **Maintains practical focus** (real-world constraints)
4. **Ensures quality** (testing, validation, monitoring)
5. **Enables evolution** (continuous improvement, technical debt management)

By following the ADA-7 framework, development teams can create high-quality software that is:
- Well-architected and scalable
- Thoroughly tested and reliable
- Properly documented and maintainable
- Evidence-based and optimized
- Ready for production and evolution
