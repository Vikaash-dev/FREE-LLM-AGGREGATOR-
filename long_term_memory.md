# Long-Term Memory: Component Evaluation Knowledge Base

## Project Overview
**Repository**: FREE-LLM-AGGREGATOR  
**Purpose**: Multi-provider LLM API aggregator with intelligent routing, account management, and fallback mechanisms  
**Primary Language**: Python 3.11+  
**Architecture**: Async-first, modular, research-backed

## Core Architecture Decisions

### Design Principles
1. **Provider Abstraction**: BaseProvider pattern for consistent interface
2. **Async-First**: All I/O operations use async/await
3. **Research-Backed**: Implements patterns from academic literature
4. **Resilience**: Circuit breakers, retries, fallbacks
5. **Intelligence**: Meta-controller for optimal model selection
6. **Observability**: Structured logging, metrics, monitoring

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: FastAPI for API layer
- **Async**: asyncio for concurrency
- **Database**: SQLite for persistence
- **ML**: PyTorch (optional) for intelligent features
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics, structlog
- **Testing**: pytest with async support
